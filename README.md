🪨 Rock vs Mine Classifier – Sonar Signal Classification
This project is a machine learning system that classifies sonar signals as either a rock or a mine based on a set of 60 numerical features derived from sonar signal readings.

It was built using Logistic Regression and enhanced with additional steps including evaluation, model deployment, and explainability.
